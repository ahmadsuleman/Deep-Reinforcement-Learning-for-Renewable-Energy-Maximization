## 📘 Project Scope

### 🌍 Background
Pelagic islands—isolated islands far from mainland grids—rely heavily on local renewable energy (RE) sources. However, due to unpredictable solar/wind conditions, some islands face shortages while others may have surplus energy. Establishing an effective and intelligent energy-sharing framework between these islands is critical to ensure consistent and optimal power supply.

### 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to **maximize the utilization of renewable energy** across a network of isolated microgrids (PINMGs) by enabling **cooperative energy sharing** via **battery swapping using ships**.

## 🧠 Technical Approach

### 🔁 Two-Stage DRL Architecture
We propose a **two-stage cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL)** approach that consists of:

1. **Central Reinforcement Learning (CRL)**  
   - Manages global-level scheduling decisions.
   - Determines optimal energy transfer from Source Islands (SIs) to Load Island Networks (LINs).

2. **Island Agents (IAs)**  
   - Operate locally on each island.
   - Handle individual energy demand/supply dynamics using local policies.

### 🧮 Algorithms Used
- **Dueling Deep Q-Networks (Dueling DQN)** for improved convergence and policy evaluation.
- **Environment Modeling** includes stochastic demand, RE generation, and dynamic battery shipping delays.
- **State and Action Perturbation Tests** to validate robustness and generalizability.

### 🛳️ Battery Swapping Mechanism
Ships transport charged batteries from surplus-producing islands to demand-heavy islands. The cost and schedule of transport are factored into the optimization.
